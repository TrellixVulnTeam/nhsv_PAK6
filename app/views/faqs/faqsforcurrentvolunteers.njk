        Design for the outcome
      </h2>
      <p>What will good look like? What are the health, wellbeing or other measurable outcomes that your work will impact? Your work should improve lives, either directly or indirectly.</p>
    </div>

        Be inclusive
      </h2>
      <p>NHS services are for everyone. Make sure people with different physical, mental health, social, cultural or learning needs can use your design.</p>

        Design for context
      </h2>
      <p>Don't just design your part of a service. Consider people's entire experience, and the infrastructure and processes involved. Think about how people begin and end their time with what you are designing.</p>
    </div>
  </li>

        Design for trust
      </h2>
      <p>People trust the NHS. Take care not to jeopardise that. Design things that are reliable and secure.</p>

        Test your assumptions
      </h2>
      <p>Design and test your work with real people. Observe behaviour and gather evidence. Work with subject experts and existing research. Do not rely on hunches.</p>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li class="featured-list--item">

        Make, learn, iterate
      </h2>
      <p>Start small. Experiment with different ways of doing things. Make prototypes to improve your understanding. Test and refine.</p>
    </div>
  </li>

    <li class="featured-list--item">

        Do the hard work to make it simple
      </h2>
      <p>Healthcare journeys can be complex. Take the time to understand what you are trying to solve. Do not push complexity onto the people using what you are designing.</p>
    </div>
  </li>

    <li class="featured-list--item">
    <div class="featured-list--item__content">

        <span class="featured-list--item__number nhsuk-heading-xl">9</span>
        Make things open. It makes things better
      </h2>
      <p>Share your learning. Share your work. Be transparent in your design decisions.</p>
      <p>Be accountable and have confidence in your solutions.</p>
