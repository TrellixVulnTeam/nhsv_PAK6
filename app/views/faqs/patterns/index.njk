  <p>We have 2 types of patterns:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>task patterns to help users complete a task, for example, give us different kinds of information</li>
    <li>page type patterns to improve navigation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Patterns often use more than 1 <a href="/faqs/components">component</a> and the guidance explains how to adapt them to the context.</p>
