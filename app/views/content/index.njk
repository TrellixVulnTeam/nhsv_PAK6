<p>Many NHS organisations and charities need help from volunteers. This is a great way to support the NHS and get involved in your community. Local NHS Trust websites usually include details of how to get involved. Volunteers are crucial to the NHSâ€™s vision for the future of health and social care, as partners with our skilled staff, not as substitutes for them. There are more than 300 types of role in the NHS alone, providing challenging and rewarding opportunities for people of all age and backgrounds. Some can be a one-off, like a hospital garden makeovers or fundraising. Others can last for months or even years, like running a hospital radio show, helping with administration in a hospice or taking part in advisory groups.</p>
